# CMU 18-740 Lab 0 gem5 Tutorial
This repository is a (heavily) modified form of the [gem5 website](https://github.com/gem5/website), used with license in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md). The modifications were done in support of Carnegie Mellon's 18-740 course.

The tutorial is a series of .md files organized as "Part 0", "Part 1", and "Part 2". Work through the files in sequence. You do not need to know everything in these files perfectly as long as you get the general idea of how gem5 works. Feel free to come back here in later labs for reference.
